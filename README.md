# odin-recipes
Odin recipes is the the first website I'll be creating during the HTML lesson of The Odin Project and hopefully this website will turn out good and with little to no problem. This project is just starting as a plain HTML code and, later on my learning journey, will be styled and modified during the CSS lessons. 

The main elements I'll be using will be the basic HTML commands, such as Lists, Images, Relative and Absolute Links, and a few more, trying my best to make this website turn out good, understandable for everyone and with a code simple, but at the same time, complex as it should be to pass this lesson and be a step closer to start my developer career.

If you're someone reviewing this, thank you for your help! all critics and help will be well received and applied. If you're future-me, hi, look how far you've come, I hope you didn't give up and are doing good on TOP.
