        <h2>What are gnocchis?</h2>
        <p>Gnocchi (singular gnocco) are Italian-like dumplings made with flour, eggs, and potatoes. Gnocchi can be served in tomato sauce, tossed with pesto, or sautéed with butter and herbs.</p>
        <p>"Gnocchi" can be difficult to pronounce for native English speakers. For future reference, gnocchi is pronounced NYOW-kee.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 medium russet potatoes, scrubbed</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour, plus more for dusting</li>
            <li>1 large egg</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How to make gnocchis?</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place potatoes in a large saucepan and cover with 2 inches of salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat; reduce heat to medium-high and simmer, undisturbed, until tender but still firm, 25 to 30 minutes. Drain potatoes and place back in the pot to dry and cool slightly, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>As soon as potatoes are cool enough to handle, peel potatoes by rubbing skins off with your hands. Pass peeled potatoes through a potato ricer into a large bowl (alternatively, mash until very smooth.) Let cool slightly, about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Fold in flour, egg, and salt until flour is incorporated and  dough starts to hold together. Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and gently knead once or twice until mostly smooth (do not overwork).</li>
            <li>Divide dough into 4 even portions. Roll and shape each portions of the dough into long "snakes," about ¾-inch in diameter.</li>
            <li>Cut snakes into about 1/2-inch long pieces. (Optional: Roll each piece against the tines of a fork or a gnocchi board to make light ridges.) Transfer shaped gnocchi to a single layer on a parchment-lined baking sheet dusted with flour.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil over high. Working in batches, drop in gnocchi and cook for 3 to 4 minutes or until gnocchi have risen to the top; transfer cooked gnocchi with a spider or slotted spoon to desired sauce.</li>
        </ol>
